# Comanglia + Class Config

## Details

- Class config has an Uber Bind and Rocket Jump Script **TURNED ON** by default. You'll need to delete or comment out those scripts if you don't want them on (in `medic.cfg` and `soldier.cfg` and `allclass.cfg`).
- Comanglia's config downloaded here: https://github.com/Comanglia/ComangliaComs

## Install

0. Ensure you don't have other configs or `.vpk`s that could have conflicting `autoexec.cfg` files. You can only have one. If you have multiples, it's your responsibility to manage these.
1. [Download](https://github.com/rufio-tf2/comanglia-with-class-config/archive/master.zip) the ZIP
1. Extract
1. On Windows, my extracted folder structure looks like `comanglia-with-class-config-master/comanglia-with-class-config-master/cfg`. Pull out the inner `comanglia-with-class-config-master` folder and delete the outer one. To be clear, the folder structure you want is `comanglia-with-class-config-master/cfg`.
1. Move this `comanglia-with-class-config-master` folder into your `tf/custom` folder.
1. Restart TF2
1. Once TF2 is loaded, open the console. You should see all of Comanglia's echo statements printed to the console.
